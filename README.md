## How to Play?
The game alternate between every player giving them a single turn. However, there's a twist! Depending on your movement speed, you may be allowed multiple actions per turn (the default is two). You're given the option to attack, move, upgrade, and worse, end your turn early. Attacking allows you to directly damage a nearby player ensuring you get closer to that shiny crown! You can move across the world and shop for upgrades too. Upgrades vary and can buff you in many ways.

I'd say you're all set, good luck on the battlefield soldier!
